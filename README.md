# Epic-Grad-Cap
The cap has an 8 by 32 grid of LED's that scrolls the message "Hi mom, I'm graduating!" The tassel of the cap is controlled by a servo motor to make your tassel go from right to left when the time comes to graduate. Also, when the tassel moves over it changes the scrolling message to be "Yay! I graduated". The yellow button enters the cap into "picture mode" where the scrolling of the lightbar stops and it simply displays "USF!" for picture taking (which there is always a lot of at a graduation).
